# Cache-Management-API-for-EMT-Classic-mode-using-Cassandra
the idea was to use the TTL ( Time To Live - this is the time in sec till the data will be present in KPS tables ) feature of the Cassandra data storage and create 5 API's that could perform CRUD operation on Cassandra KPS tables to store data like a distributed cache.
